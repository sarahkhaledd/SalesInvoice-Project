# SalesInvoice-Project
 This project requires you to create a "Sales Invoice Generator" using Java programming language.  A sales invoice is an accounting document that records a business transaction. It provides the business with a record of the services theyâ€™ve provided to a client, when the services were rendered and how much money the client owes the business.  Typically, a sales invoice will include a description of the service provided and the amount owed. Sales invoices are crucial to small-business accounting because they enable you to record transactions of your sales for bookkeeping purposes.
